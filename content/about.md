At Wombil, we create partnerships with local shops and homeowners to provide WiFi hotspots that are available to anyone with a smart device. A shop owner is given a router and proprietry software to generate data codes. These data codes can then be sold to customers to provide the customer with a fixed amount of data that they can use for that hotspot. Our prices are extremely competitive, and you have the convenience of a shop nearby while you use the internet. Our aim is to uplift these amazing communities through access to the internet, which is key resource in access to information.
